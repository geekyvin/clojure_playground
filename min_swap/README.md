There are n-pairs and therefore 2N people. everyone has one unique number ranging from 1 to 2N. All these 2N persons are arranged in random fashion in an Array of size 2N. We are also given who is partner of whom.

Example:

N=3

1->3 , 2->6 ,4->5

where 1 is partner of 3, 2 is of 6 and so on.

Given Array: 3,5,6,4,1,2

Output  could be : 3,1,5,4,6,2 with 2 no. of swaps.

We have to arrange these 2N persons with minimum no. of swaps such that partners are sitting adjacent to each other.
